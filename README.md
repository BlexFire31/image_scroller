# image_scroller

This app is meant to be a concept about how it can learn from the user's actions (clicking on an image the user likes)
and using that information to show images that the user will hopefully like

Each image that is displayed to the user in a grid form has a title property, which more or less describes the image
When the user clicks on the image, the app stores all the words and phrases from the title and assigns them a score
if the word/phrase has appeared several times the score will increase, which will increase the "popularity" of that word/phrase
which will make it appear more in the home screen

when you first open the app, it greets you with a setup screen and asks you to pick a favorite color and a few topics to show images of
this is to provide the app a base of what your interests are

Over time, the app gets better at finding out what you like and shows better images
If you do not like the images that you see, you can scroll down and refresh

The search feature allows you to search for different images and teach the app about what you like

You can also like an image and save it for later and view it under the home menu icon and then press the heart button
